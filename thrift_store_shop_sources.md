**Relation to my App:**  
Amazon is an existing and "competing" program that serves as a broad marketplace for buying and selling goods, including used items. However, it can also serve as a resource for understanding e-commerce features and user experience design that may benefit my app.

**Description:**  
Amazon is one of the largest online marketplaces in the world. It offers a wide range of products, including electronics, clothing, books, and household items. Users can buy new and used items from third-party sellers or directly from Amazon. Amazon also provides services like Amazon Prime, which offers faster shipping and access to streaming services. Amazon’s platform is known for its user-friendly interface, extensive search and filter options, and reliable customer service.

**Relation to my Goal:**  
Amazon’s features relevant to my Panther Thrift Shop app include its extensive product categorization, search functionality, and user reviews system. These features contribute to a streamlined and trustworthy shopping experience. For my app, focusing on a simplified, intuitive interface with solid search capabilities will be crucial to helping students and faculty easily find items. Additionally, incorporating a review system could help build trust within the campus community, as users can provide feedback on sellers and products, similar to Amazon’s review feature.
