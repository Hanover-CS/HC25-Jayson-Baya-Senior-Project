# CS Senior Project Proposal: Panther Thrift Shop

Description:
This Panther Thrift Shop aims to open space and focus on the benefit of all students who want to sell and buy their used and new products across campus. This is a web application that can be accessed on all browser platforms. This will help all students in selling their items before, during, and after class. I personally think that this will help all student in recycling.
