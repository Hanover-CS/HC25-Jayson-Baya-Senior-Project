# **CS Senior Project Proposal: Panther Thrift Shop**

### **1. Introduction**
The **Panther Thrift Shop** web application aims to provide a convenient, campus-specific platform where students can buy and sell used or new items, encouraging recycling and affordable exchanges. The platform focuses on ease of use, allowing students to browse, buy, and sell goods such as clothing, shoes, appliances, room decor, and textbooks directly through the application. By catering exclusively to students, this project enhances accessibility, trust, and community engagement.

### **2. Project Features**
The Panther Thrift Shop will incorporate several key features aimed at improving the buying and selling experience for users:

1. **Product Categories**:
    - Items will be organized into specific categories such as:
        - Men's Clothing (Shirts, Pants, Shoes)
        - Women's Clothing (Shirts, Pants, Shoes)
        - Appliances
        - Room Decoration
        - Textbooks, and more.

2. **Product Listings and Images**:
    - Sellers can upload multiple images of their products, offering a detailed view of item conditions and quality.

3. **Seller Review System**:
    - Buyers can leave feedback and reviews for sellers, promoting trust and accountability in transactions.

4. **Shopping Cart**:
    - Buyers will have the option to add multiple items to their shopping cart, simplifying the purchasing process.

5. **Real-Time Chat**:
    - A built-in real-time chat feature will allow buyers and sellers to communicate directly about product details, negotiations, and logistics.

6. **Transaction Status Updates**:
    - **Seller Mark as Sold**: Once an item has been purchased, the seller can mark the product as "Sold" to avoid future inquiries.
    - **Buyer Mark as Received**: After completing a transaction and receiving the item, buyers can mark the product as "Received," confirming the completion of the deal.

7. **Flexible Payment Options**:
    - While the platform does not handle payment processing directly, transactions can be arranged through external methods such as Venmo, cash, or any other preferred payment method. This flexibility enables buyers and sellers to make secure transactions outside of the platform.

8. **Responsive Web Design**:
    - The application will be accessible through various browser platforms.

### **3. Technologies**

1. **React (JavaScript Library)**:
    - React is a powerful front-end JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It allows for fast and efficient rendering of dynamic content, making it ideal for building interactive and responsive web applications like **Panther Thrift Shop**. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture will help in organizing and managing different parts of the application (e.g., product listings, chat functionality, cart system) more effectively, allowing for reusable and maintainable code. 

2. **Next.js (React Framework)**:
    - Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, which enhances performance and SEO for web applications. By using Next.js for the **Panther Thrift Shop**, the application will benefit from faster page loads and improved scalability. Next.js also simplifies routing and provides a robust development environment, making it easier to build complex features like product listings, real-time chat, and user authentication.


3. **JavaScript (Programming Language)**:
    - JavaScript will be used as the primary programming language for the application. It is essential for creating interactive features such as real-time chat, form validation, dynamic updates (e.g., adding items to the cart without refreshing the page), and other behaviors that enhance user experience. JavaScript also seamlessly integrates with React, enabling smooth operation of all interactive elements of the web app.


4. **HTML (Markup Language)**:
    - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure the content of web pages. For **Panther Thrift Shop**, HTML will be used to define the structure of the web pages, such as product categories, product listings, forms, and user interfaces. It ensures that the content is properly displayed and accessible to users across different devices and browsers.


5. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
    - CSS is responsible for the visual styling of the web application. In **Panther Thrift Shop**, CSS will be used to design an attractive and responsive layout, ensuring that the web app looks clean, modern, and functions well on a variety of devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones). Features such as product galleries, navigation menus, and chat windows will be visually enhanced through CSS to improve user engagement and experience.
