# Introduction
Introduction
Routing is the backbone of Next.js applications, built around an intuitive file-system structure. By leveraging this, Next.js allows developers to map files within the pages directory directly to URL paths, eliminating the need for complex configurations and making routing as simple as adding a new file. This method simplifies page creation and supports nested routes, dynamic parameters, and more.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the file-based routing system in Next.js and how it simplifies URL path mapping.
2. Learn how to create and structure initial pages and shared layouts in Next.js.
3. Explore dynamic routing for user-specific pages and variable content.
4. Gain knowledge about Next.js navigation tools, such as the Link component and useRouter hook.
5. Discover advanced customization options with App and Document components.
6. Integrate back-end functionality using API routes within a Next.js application.
7. Implement multilingual support and middleware for enhanced global accessibility and request handling.

In Next.js, you can create initial pages and shared layouts, setting up a foundation for a cohesive user experience. Additionally, Next.js allows you to integrate dynamic routes for paths that require custom parameters—perfect for handling user-specific pages or content with variable IDs.

The framework also enhances navigation with built-in support for the Link component and useRouter hook, providing developers with seamless ways to manage page transitions and redirect users. Furthermore, with the option to override the App and Document components, Next.js enables global layout and structural customizations, offering fine-grained control over the initialization and markup of every page.

Next.js supports additional features like API routes, allowing you to create back-end functionality directly within the app and custom error pages for better user feedback. Internationalization and language detection are natively supported for multilingual applications, making global accessibility straightforward. Finally, middleware provides a way to intercept and modify requests before they reach their destination, which is useful for tasks like authentication.

This guide covers these elements in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to structure, navigate, and enhance your Next.js application. Whether you’re building a static website, a complex app with dynamic data, or a globally accessible platform, Next.js routing features make it an efficient and powerful choice.
