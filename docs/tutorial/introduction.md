# Introduction
Routing is the backbone of Next.js applications, built around an intuitive file-system structure. By leveraging this, 
Next.js allows developers to map files within the pages directory directly to URL paths, eliminating the need for complex 
configurations and making routing as simple as adding a new file. This method not only simplifies page creation but also supports nested routes, 
dynamic parameters, and more.

In Next.js, you can create your initial pages and shared layouts, setting up a foundation for a cohesive user experience. 
Additionally, Next.js allows you to integrate dynamic routes for paths that require custom parameters—perfect for handling 
user-specific pages or content with variable IDs.

The framework also enhances navigation with built-in support for the Link component and useRouter hook, providing developers 
with seamless ways to manage page transitions and redirect users. Furthermore, with the option to override the App and Document components, 
Next.js enables global layout and structural customizations, offering fine-grained control over the initialization and markup of every page.

Next.js supports additional features like API routes, allowing you to create back-end functionality directly within the app, 
and custom error pages for better user feedback. For multilingual applications, internationalization and language detection are natively supported, 
making global accessibility straightforward. Finally, middleware provides a way to intercept and modify requests before they reach their destination, 
which is highly useful for tasks like authentication.

This guide covers each of these elements in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to structure, navigate, 
and enhance your Next.js application. Whether you’re building a static website, a complex app with dynamic data, 
or a globally accessible platform, Next.js routing features make it an efficient and powerful choice.
