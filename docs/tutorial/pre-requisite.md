# Pre-requisites for Learning Routing in Next.js

Before getting started with routing in Next.js, make sure you have a solid foundation and the necessary tools in place. This section covers the required knowledge, tools, and a quick setup guide to ensure you’re ready to follow along.

## Required Knowledge

To make the most of this guide, you should have:

- Basic understanding of **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **React** concepts, such as components, hooks, and JSX
- Basic experience with **Next.js** and package managers like **npm** or **yarn**

## Tools You'll Need

- A code editor, such as **VSCode**, **Webstorm**, or **IntelliJ**
- **Node.js** installed on your system (preferably the latest stable version)
- **npm** or **yarn** to manage project dependencies

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up your Next.js project:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven’t installed Node.js yet, download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions. Node.js comes bundled with npm, so you’ll be ready to install packages right away.

2. **Create a Next.js Project**:  
   Open your terminal and create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
