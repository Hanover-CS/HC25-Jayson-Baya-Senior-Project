# Routing in Next.js
Routing is a fundamental aspect of web development, determining how users navigate through different pages of an application. 
In Next.js, routing is file-system based, making it intuitive and efficient. By simply adding files to the `pages` directory, 
you create routes that are instantly accessible. This eliminates the need for complex route definitions, streamlining the development process. 
Next.js also supports advanced features like dynamic routing, API routes, and internationalization, 
allowing for versatile and scalable applications.
